# Question 1: What does it mean to install a program on your computer?

Installing a program typically means code or a program being copied from the installation files to new, local files on the computer. Installing a file to a computer will mean a direct copy or generation to the local hard drive.

# Question 2: Describe the differences and similarities between the installation process for software that you found in your research. ü§ìRemember to add the citation for your sources.

Most programs are installed from the internet and most web pages have an easy to follow UX so programs can be installed with a click of a button. Other softwares can be directly transferred from an external hard drive or a USB drive. 

MacOS and WindowsOS: After installing, the downloaded files will fall into the download folder in the integrated Finder or explorer app. The system may prompt some security warnings when moving the installed app from the downloaded folder to the application folder. 

LinuxOS: For Linux software, not only can programs be installed from the internet but also can be directly installed from repositories through the Linux command line. The exact command differs, but it typically will require typing ‚Äú$sudo‚Äù (command for each repository) install (software from said repository).

# Question 3: Consider  your digital counting system and the different types of system installation presented in the textbook. Justify the choice of one installation system for your digital counter. 

For our digital counting system, a parallel changeover will work the best for us. Our counting system for our client is an important part of his life and is required to run 24 hours a day non-stop to ensure the client knows the time at any given time. By using a parallel changeover, we will be able to not only utilize and ensure the continuation of our old system but also implement our new system when it's completely done and stable swiftly with a low risk of failure. 

# Question 4: What strategies could you use to provide user documentation for your digital counting system?

Since our digital counting system is a relatively easy to use system, we will provide a simple manual in paper form with the system and in digital PDF form on our repository. Our manual will include some basic functions of our system and include instructions to adjust the time and to turn on and off the system. Other than that, a simple F&Q of our system will also help the users resolve any common questions such as how to turn on the system and or how to adjust time zones etc. 

# Question 5: Think about ways to improve the usability, usefulness and desirability of your digital counter. Describe how your counter system addresses these three fundamental parts of the UX.

Usefulness: Our counter was designed to display time and numeric values in the form of light and sound, so to make sure the system is useful, we will make sure the light is bright enough to visually see and the sound it makes is loud enough so it is audible for everyone. Moreover, as a clock, the clock should be accurate and should follow a standard time around the world. 

Usability: To make sure our counter is usable, we will make it so the counter and clock can be turned on and adjusted without the knowledge of roman numerals and make it more accessible and easy to understand by utilizing the user documentation for a general understanding of the processes involved in, for example, adjusting the timezone of the clock. 

Desirable: To make this a desirable product and counter, our product will make sure to be cheap and durable over time. Other than that, the Arduino system will be encased by an elegant modern design that isn't too distracting and fits into most demographics, age and room wise.
